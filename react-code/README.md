## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to create a Recipe Page Component, a webpage showcasing recipes in a structured list manner with proper steps and indentation marked for an in-depth explanation of the processes involved at each step, accompanied by images for users to follow along. Users should be able to see a centralized responsive page, ensuring that the structure of the webpage and images are visible wide and clear in the proper format and order.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Recipe-page_frontend_project.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project is the second project that I am making which further has allowed me to learn about further advanced concepts like hover states, centering div inside parent element, flexbox etc as shown in code snippet below-

```css
.mainframe {
    margin: auto;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    /* align-items: center; */
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 50%;
    padding: 15px;
    margin-top: 7rem;
    margin-bottom: 7rem;
    background-color: var(--rose-white);
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px 17px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.244);
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
